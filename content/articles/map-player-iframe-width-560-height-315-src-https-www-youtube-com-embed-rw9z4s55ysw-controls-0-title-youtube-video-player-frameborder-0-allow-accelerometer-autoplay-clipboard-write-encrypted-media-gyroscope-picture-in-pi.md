Dr Octagon is a fictional character, a gynecologist-surgeon from outer space. Lending his voice to the persona, it’s an outlet for Kool Keith’s most perverted fantasies.

Rappers fantasizing about sex is nothing new. The result usually lands somewhere between high-school level bragging and basic misogynist barking. But on a rare occasion, the art of pornographic prose is taken to the next level. 

On *Girl Let Me Touch You*, Keith muses about a female patient entering Dr Octagon’s clinic. Wordplay and fetish intermingle, concrete fantasies wittily visualized and delivered. Skillful in its perversion, a kind of ghetto [Louis Paul Boon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Paul_Boon), if you will. 



> *It's morning, 7 o'clock, you at my clinic
> It's me your orthopedic, gynecologyst
> You looking pretty and fine, go ahead blow my mind
> Girl what's wrong come here, let me take a look
> You say you got burnt, your man should've wore a rubber
> What type of partners you have and who's your first lover
> He never turned you around, showed you doggystyle
> We got some things in common, honey, let's talk awhile
> Did he lick you there? Percolate your atmosphere?
> I got a mask at home, boots, and some leather gear
> How about me and you in black? I'm hittin' from the back
> Tail in my face, and all juicy, brown booty
> I'm the master, rubber splits, let me do my duty
> Girl, let me touch you*
>
> *< chorus >*
>
> *Sipping Manischewitz smooth—you’re cute—drinking Hennessy
> Jokin' 'bout two girls, your friend double-teamin' me
> I got the office closed, you ready for the pros
> Suckers ain't no good, sticking coke up in your nose
> My style is wild at home and on the kitchen table
> Porno-flicks in stacks, Playboy on the TV cable
> I'd rather sign my address on your application
> You can call late nights for lonely information
> Where you come when it's boring? A place—where to go?
> I want you in a two-piece, and freaky, for a private show
> You got my number, address—you know the rest*
>
> *< chorus >*
>
> *Only 18, bikini-body bad and mean
> Do you have cards? In fact, I will take Medicaid
> Your panties are wet—take it easy, don't sweat
> You want some birth-control? You can smoke a cigarette
> Relax, lay back, your buns feel good to smack
> You think you're pregnant—your test show negative
> I got a movie camera film that is positive
> Turn around for me, girl, take a picture
> This is the way with 24 flicks on Kodak
> Them young boys ain't ready, so let me show them how to act
> I put you in thongs and six-inch high shoes
> You strut your stuff in latex, my strategy is rough*
