If there was ever a place a *saucisseke* wouldn’t *zweet*, it would surely be the Russian taiga. And if there was ever one thing to pique my curiosity, it was that time someone said: "You should listen to this. It’s a snow opera by a guy that looks a bit like an Eskimo." That Eskimo was Kola Beldy and he was actually of [Nanai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanai_people) descent, a people living in the most eastern parts of Siberia. 

Kola’s life story is pure Hollywood material. He became an orphan fairly quicky after birth, developing a strong stutter as a consequence. At barely 13 years old he ran away and joined the army, lying about his age. There, he supposedly lost his stutter, amazing his brothers-in-arms with his beautiful voice. Somewhere along the way he entered music school, all while doing a pretty good job serving in the Navy, for he received several medals and 'the order of the Patriotic war for the liberation of Korea'. In 1957 he participated in a youth festival and won, gaining the attention of Moscow’s *Ministry of Culture*. From thereon, Kola’s music career took off, spanning no less than three decades of life and success on the road.

But back to the music. *White Island* (1989) definitely belongs in the ‘musical’ category. Rather than songs, the album is made up of acts. Most are characterized by Kola’s grandiose singing, making it easy to visualize our Nanai friend on stage in one of Moscow’s most respected opera houses. 

Song titles are on par too. There’s *Strange girls*, *My little reindeer*, *Toasting song*... And to top it off, the album sports some oddly funky moves as well. The modest production values of *A hunter* and *My darling* result in a lo-fi bumping swagger, bringing to mind Ariel Pink. 

The album’s final track is *Fisher’s song*. Not even remotely resembling a grand finale for an opera, this mellow sing-along groover could neatly accompany the ending credits of an Asian 80’s movie. An ending perfectly fitted for the curveball that is *White Island*.
