This is ‘true’ music, a record I’ve found in the best record shop I’ve ever been: Het Leger Des Heils in Brussels. She is a somewhat obscure figure from the early 2000’s Belgian Freak Folk Scene that I stumbled upon through the release by Ignatz and Gerard Herman. She has a non-binary voice, long hair and a beard (!!!), and was a vanguard — I suppose, there’s not many information available, and most info on Discogs is in Vlamisch, an isolated language I don’t master as digital native. Her name is Jan De Wilde, or ‘Joan The Wild’, if you could even translate it. The songs have a ring towards the mid-sixties (think Robert Zimmerman on his early bootlegs), but lack the positive, utopian vibe of that era. The sound is outstandingly lo-fi in its sarcastic, morbid, central European vibe. Killer song is "De Boeman", which — upon copy-pasting the lyrics into Linguee — is obviously a poetic criticism of the notorious blackface rituals in Belgium. My personal favorite, in between the micro-moments of sublime pleasure, is "Loebeke", a slow 7/8th rhythm based song that recalls Vlamisch ethnic music. I found out Loebeke is a small Belgian village where nothing happens, and is featured on a later, more classical oriented song by her, dubbed "Aaigem" — by the way: -gem and -beke mean ‘shithole’ apparently. Belgian etymology is a strange thing; I always wondered why Lomax forgot the region to field-record… One point of a criticism: the song "Joke" is a song that sounds funny, but is not at all a fun thing (and a mid-level pun) and a cheap try to make a hit. For the rest: highly recommended, I hope there will be a re-press soon.
