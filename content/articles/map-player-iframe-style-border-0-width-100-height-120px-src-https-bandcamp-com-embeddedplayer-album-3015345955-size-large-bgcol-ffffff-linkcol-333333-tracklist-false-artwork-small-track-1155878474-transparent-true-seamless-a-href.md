Staying within a theme always works. Take Italian cuisine for example. Blowing you away with the most basic dishes, it’s the go-to food for all occasions. Everybody likes it, because it’s so good, but also because it’s so reliable: you know what you’re gonna get. It doesn’t matter if it’s mozzarella-tomato-basil or tomato-aubergine-parmigiano. Cream-bacon-eggs or cacio e pepe... They’re all mere variations on the same theme. 

That’s why [Vitello Tonnato](https://www.greatitalianchefs.com/recipes/vitello-tonnato-recipe) is such an oddity in the Italian cookbook. A surf-and-turf delight, covering pristine veal in a salty anchovy sauce. Fish and meat, cream and capers… where did that come from all of a sudden? Whatever its origins: by moving past obvious pairings, a dish arose that’s as surprising as it’s effective. Staying in character rarely offends, but only coloring outside the lines has the potential to compel. Just like Cindy Lee’s *What’s Tonight To Eternity* (2020). 

The album’s an unusual mix of syrupy arrangements (think Richard Hawley), 80’s movie synths (think *[Escape from New York](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10OoccK7dIw)*) and noise. You’d be forgiven to find this combination rather random, especially after a largely unrelated introduction about Italian food. But random as it may seem, it works to phenomenal extent, resulting in a hopelessly romantic album, a thing of intense beauty. Like a rose on a dirty floor, smudged from being stepped upon, somehow still retaining some of its vivid vermilion color, breaking your heart.
