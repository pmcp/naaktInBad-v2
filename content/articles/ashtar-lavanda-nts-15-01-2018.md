What do Kevin Saunderson, Derrick May and Jeff Mills have in common? They’re all people of color. They’re all techno originators. And most importantly – for this column anyway - they’re all from Detroit. 

While techno’s commonly associated with dark, pummeling sounds, Detroit has often been home to the more melodic strains of the genre. Case in point: Saunderson caught one of his biggest breaks with [Good Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJxJxr9RlKM), under the Inner City moniker. The song’s synth stabs mean business, but it could hardly be qualified as a banger. May created one of techno’s mellowest anthems: [Strings of Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFQZndywOR4). And while Mills might be best known for [The Bells](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwpedKWwS3w), his [floatier productions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHmBxqLhD40) were just as effective in guiding clubbers towards ecstasy.

Ashtar Lavanda also hails from the Motor City. An obscure artist making electro & techno in the ‘90s, he was escorted out of oblivion by [Jimmy Edgar](https://jimmyedgar.bandcamp.com/), who supposedly found a box containing his DATs and tapes in an old storage unit. 

This mix of 100% Lavanda material breathes Detroit, taking lots of cues from the boogie funk Ashtar probably listened to. It has plenty of kick to keep it going, we’re talking electro after all. But at the same time it’s a smooth ride on the colorful end of the electro spectrum, an antipode to the dystopic sci-fi visuals often used in the genre. Just feel that vibe at 20’30”. No futuristic spaceships or asteroids here. Just a low riding convertible, cruising on a sunny day.
