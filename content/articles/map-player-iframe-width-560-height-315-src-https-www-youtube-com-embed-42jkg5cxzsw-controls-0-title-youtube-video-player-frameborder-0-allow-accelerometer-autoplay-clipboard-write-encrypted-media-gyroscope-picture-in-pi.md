It’s the end of the ‘90s and trip hop is inescapable. The smoked-out samples are not that bad, in an uninspired-yet-comfortable way. But one more bar of that boom-bap beat and the boredom turns into unbearable suffering. 

Enter Clifford Gilberto. He, too, samples his way through jazz, samba, etc... But instead of contenting himself with a lazy end result, Clifford repurposes said samples for structures that often outshine the energy levels of the original. Jungle tropes tangle with frenetic jazz moves. Hi-hats hit you over the head whilst that bass makes for a certain mellowness, even when moving at lightning speed. 

Rushing and vibing simultaneously: soul for those who couldn’t take slow no more.
